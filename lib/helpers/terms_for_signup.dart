TERMS OF USE

These Terms of Use govern the use of the mobile Application provided by E-rrunds. Please read these Terms of Use carefully as they contain important information regarding your use of the Application. These terms affect your legal rights, obligations, and remedies. By accessing and using the Application, you agree that you have read, understood, and accepted the Terms, including any additional conditions and terms available on the Application. If you are not in agreement or fall within the Terms, please do not use the Application.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Rider" refers to individuals seeking to run errands for Customers

"Customer" refers to individuals and/or businesses seeking to obtain short-term services ("Errand")

"Application" means E-rrunds application downloaded onto mobile devices.

"User" refers to an individual who creates an account to gain access to the Application. Customers and Riders together are, after this, referred to as "Users." 

2. PURPOSE OF E-RRUNDS

E-rrunds is a mobile service application that enables customers to schedule errands and directly transact with the Riders. Through the Application, the Riders will be notified of Customers seeking the services they offer, and Customers may be notified of Riders that may offer the services they seek.
 
Our objective is to make it easier for any customers requiring help with their errands, services, and purchases in person and/or collection of products from local businesses to carry out their errands by delegating to such riders who are willing to voluntarily carry out the mandate given to them by the customers.

E-rrunds does not complete errands and does not employ riders to run errands. E-rrunds processes customers' orders from our Application and manages users' experience throughout the errand process.

3. E-RRUNDS ACCOUNTS

Before the User can schedule errands using our Application, he/she needs to open an E-rrunds account. When Users opens an account, he/she may create a password. Users must keep any password they create secret and prevent others from accessing their email account or mobile phone. If another person uses these methods to access a User account, he/she will be responsible for paying for any errands scheduled, and E-rrunds is not responsible for any other losses the User suffers unless the person using the User's password obtained it because we did not keep it secure.

User Access and Registration

In order to be a User of the Application, it is required to meet the following requirements:
-> Users must be at least aged 18 years old.
-> Users must truthfully complete the mandatory fields of the registration form requesting personal details such as the User's name, email address, cellphone number.
 ->Users must agree to these Terms of Use.
-> Users must agree to the Data Privacy Policy.

When registering on the Application, Users must provide a valid email and password. Both the email and the password are strictly confidential, personal, and non-transferable. The User warrants that all the information and details regarding his/her identity and capacity provided to E-rrunds in the registration forms for the Application is true, accurate, and complete. In addition, Users undertake to keep their information updated.

If a User provides any false, misleading, inaccurate, or incomplete information or if E-rrunds considers that there are sufficient reasons to doubt the accuracy, truthfulness, or integrity of such information, E-rrunds may remove that User current or future access to the Application or any of its contents and/or services.

Users undertake not to disclose the information and details of their account or allow access to it to third parties. Users shall be solely responsible for any use of such details or the Application's services that third parties may make, including the statements and/or contents entered on the Application, or for any other action carried out under their username and/or password.

E-rrunds cannot guarantee the identity of registered users, and it will therefore not be liable for the use by unregistered third parties of a registered User's identity. Users undertake to inform E-rrunds immediately, using the communication channels made available by E-rrunds, if their credentials are stolen, disclosed, or lost.

Account Types

The two (2) types of E-rrunds Accounts are the Customer Account and the Rider Account.
​
CUSTOMER ACCOUNT

7. CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CUSTOMER AND RIDER

Service Contract between Customer and Rider

If a Customer and a Rider connect using the Application and enter into a service contract for a project, the service contract refers to a contractual relationship between the Customer and the Rider exclusively between them. 

Users understand and accept that E-rrunds is not a party to such service contracts and that the realization of a service contract between Users does not create an employment, partnership, joint venture, or other service connection between E-rrunds and the Users under any circumstances.

Customers and Riders may enter into any written agreements (e.g., confidentiality agreements, invention assignment agreements, assignment of rights, etc.) concerning any service contract, provided that such agreements do not conflict with, limit, or expand E-rrunds' rights and obligations under the Terms of Use.

Disputes Among Users

Users agree to follow the dispute resolution process outlined in these Terms of Use that applies to the Users' specific service contract in a dispute between Customers and Riders related to the access and use of the Application. Users understand and accept that E-rrunds will not and is not bound to give any dispute help if the dispute process does not resolve the problem between them.

E-rrunds, its officers, agents, partners, employees, and service providers are as a result of this released from all claims, demands, and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with any dispute you have with another User. This release covers, but is not limited to, disputes over a Rider's performance and quality of Riders' services delivered to Customers, as well as a Customer's failure to pay for Riders' services rendered.     

8. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

All industrial and intellectual property rights on the Application and the contents that may be accessed through it are owned by E-rrunds. The Application's intellectual property rights, as well as the text, images, graphic design, navigation structure, information, and contents contained therein, are owned by E-rrunds, who has the sole right to exploit those rights in any way, including reproduction, distribution, publication, and transformation.

Authorizing a User to use the Application does not mean that E-rrunds has waived, transferred, or assigned any intellectual or industrial property rights in whole or in part. It is forbidden to delete, circumvent, or otherwise tamper with the contents of the E-rrunds Application. Modifying, copying, reusing, exploiting, reproducing, publicizing, making second or subsequent publications of, uploading files, sending by post, transmitting, using, processing, or distributing in any way all or some of the contents included in the E-rrunds Application for public or commercial purposes is also prohibited, unless E-rrunds’ express written authorization or, where applicable, that of the owner of the rights concerned is obtained.

Any User who shares any content through the Application states that he or she has all required rights to do so, absolving E-rrunds of any duty for the content and legality of the information provided. Users convey the exploitation rights on intellectual or industrial property originating from such content to E-rrunds free of charge and the utmost extent permissible by current legislation by contributing content through the Application.

9. WARRANTY AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

E-rrunds Warranty

E-rrunds disclaims all explicit and implied conditions, representations, and warranties, including, but not limited to, the warranties of accuracy, title, and non-infringement, to the fullest extent permissible by applicable law. Some jurisdictions may not permit all of the warranty limits mentioned above. Thus some or all of the limitations mentioned above may not apply to the User. In the event of any faults, nonconformances, or dissatisfaction, the term and termination stipulate the User's exclusive remedy against E-rrunds. You agree not to place any reliance on the Application or its continuation.

Limitations of Liability of E-rrunds

The limitations would apply to any liability arising from any cause of action, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or otherwise, arising out of or in connection with this agreement or the other terms of service, even if advised of the possibility of such costs or damages and also if the limited remedies provided fail of their essential purpose.

10. INDEMNIFICATION

Users agree to keep E-rrunds, its affiliates, officers, employees, and agents harmless from all Indemnified Claims and Indemnified Liabilities connected to or arising out of:
Users' or Users' agents' use of the Application, including any payment obligations or defaults incurred as a result of using the Application Services;

Any claims, damages, liabilities, costs, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and all related expenses and costs)relating to or arising out of any claim, suit, proceeding, demand, or action brought by User, a third party, or another User against an Indemnified Party are referred to as an Indemnified Claim.

Any claims, damages, liabilities, costs, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and all related expenses and costs) relating to or arising out of any claim, suit, proceeding, demand, or action brought by an Indemnified Party against User, a third party, or another User are referred to as Indemnified Liability.

11. AGREEMENT TERM AND TERMINATION

Termination

Unless both User and E-rrunds expressly agree in writing, either User or E-rrunds may terminate the binding effect of the Terms of Use Agreement at any time, with or without cause, by giving the other written notice. The Application allows the User to give written notice of termination. When the binding effect of the Terms of Use is correctly terminated, the User's right to use the Application and its services is automatically withdrawn, and the User's account is closed. Because E-rrunds is not a party to any service contract entered into by Users, the termination of this agreement (or any attempt to terminate this agreement) has no bearing on any service contract or project entered into by Users. Users acknowledge that if they try to cancel the binding effect of these Terms of Use while they have one or more ongoing projects, they will be held liable. 

These Terms of Service will bind users until all projects on the Application have been completed;
E-rrunds will continue to provide the Application Services required to finish any open project or related transaction between Users; and
Users will remain liable to E-rrunds for any Application Services or any other amounts owed under the Terms of Use, as of the date of termination or the closure of any pending service contracts, whichever is later, and to any Rider for any services for any amounts accrued but unpaid as of the date of termination or the closure of any pending service contracts, whichever is later.

E-rrunds may, without limiting any other rights or remedies, cancel User's access to the Application, deny User's registration, or permanently terminate User's access to the Application and refuse to provide any or all Services to users if:

Users violate any of the Terms of Service's terms and conditions,
E-rrunds suspects or learns that Users have submitted E-rrunds with incorrect or misleading information, or
E-rrunds believes that User's activities may expose other Users, E-rrunds, or its affiliates to legal liability that may be contrary to the Application's or other Users' interests or may entail illicit or criminal activity.​

Users accept and agree that the Application's value, reputation, and goodwill are dependent on the Application's account status being transparent to all users. As a result, Users agree as follows:

If E-rrunds decides to close a User's account temporarily or permanently, E-rrunds has the right, if permitted by law, to:

Notify other Users who have entered into service contracts with the User that the User's account has been closed;
Provide a summary of the reasons for a User's account closure to those Users. Users agree that E-rrunds will have no liability resulting from or connected to any notice it may provide to a user regarding the status of a closed account or the reason(s) for the closure.​

Account Data on Closure

Except where otherwise required by law, if a User's account is closed for any reason, the User will lose access to any data, messages, files, or other materials stored on the Application, and any closure of a User's account may result in the deletion of any content stored in such User's account, for which E-rrunds will bear no responsibility. E-rrunds may store part or all of such User's account information in its sole discretion and as permitted or required by law.

Dispute Resolution

Any dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms of Use, including any question about their existence, termination, or validity, shall be submitted to and eventually resolved by arbitration in the Philippines, under Philippines arbitration procedures. The arbitration will be conducted in English. The arbitrator's fees shall be equally borne by the parties, except that the arbitrator may mandate that such amounts be paid in any other way that the arbitrator deems necessary for the arbitration clause to be enforceable under applicable law.

Survival

The terms of these Terms of Use that expressly or by their nature envision performance after the binding effect of these Terms of Use terminates will survive and remain in full force and effect following the termination or expiration of a User's Account. Without limiting any other provisions of the Terms of Use, the termination of a User account for any reason does not relieve a User or E-rrunds of any obligations incurred prior to the termination of a User account, or the binding effect of these Terms of Use or that may accrue after 
that in respect of any act or omission committed prior to such termination.

12. GENERAL

Entire Agreement

This agreement, along with the other Terms of Use, contains the entire agreement and understanding between User and E-rrunds relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof and cancels and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous discussions, agreements, representations, warranties, and other communications between you and us, whether written or oral, to the extent they relate in any way to the subject matter hereof and thereof. The section headers in Terms of Use are presented for convenience and have no legal significance. Users represent that they had adequate opportunity to evaluate and decide whether or not to agree to the Terms of Use, even though E-rrunds developed them. There shall be no presumption or burden of proof favoring or disfavoring User or E-rrunds because of the authorship of any part of the Terms of Use if ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation of the Terms of Use arises.

Modifications; Waiver

E-rrunds will not be bound by any modification or alteration to the Terms of Use unless posted on the Application by E-rrunds. The failure of E-rrunds to act in response to a User's breach does not renounce E-rrunds' right to act in response to subsequent or similar breaches. E-rrunds cannot promise that it will take action in response to all violations of these Terms of Service.

Assignability

Without E-rrunds' prior written agreement in the form of a written instrument signed by a fully authorized representative of E-rrunds, the User may not assign the Terms of Use or any of its rights or responsibilities hereunder. Without the User's approval, E-rrunds may freely assign this Agreement and the other Terms of Use. Any attempted assignment or transfer that violates this provision is invalid. The Terms of Use are binding and will inure to benefit the parties' successors, heirs, and permitted assignee, subject to the preceding restrictions.

Severability

If and to the extent that any provision of these Terms of Use is found to be unlawful or invalid in whole or in part under applicable law, such provision or portion thereof will be ineffective in the jurisdiction in which it is found to be illegal or invalid to the extent of its illegality, invalidity, or unenforceability and will be deemed modified to the extent necessary to conform to applicable law in order to give the maximum effect to the intent of the parties. The illegality, invalidity, or unenforceability of such provision in that jurisdiction has no bearing on the legality, validity, or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction or on the legality, validity, or enforceability of any other provision in any other jurisdiction.

Force Majeure

E-rrunds and the Rider will not be liable for any failure to perform or delay in performing any obligation hereunder for a reasonable period due to accidents, fires, labor disturbances, floods, telecommunications or Internet failures, wars, strikes, riots, rebellions, blockades, acts of government, governmental regulations and requirements or restrictions imposed by law, or other similar conditions beyond their reasonable control.

Governing Law

These Terms of Use shall be interpreted and governed according to the laws of the Philippines.
